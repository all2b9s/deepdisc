This is an updated repo of the original implementation (https://github.com/burke86/astro_rcnn)

## Description:

DeepDISC is a deep learning framework for efficiently performing source detection, classification, and segmnetation (deblending) on astronomical images.  We have built the code using detectron2 https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for a modular design an access to state-of-the-art models. 

## Installation:

1) Create a conda environment.  We recommend using python 3.9.  You can use the environment.yml file provided and run  
   `conda env create -f environment.yml`  

or create an environment from scratch and install by hand the packages listed in the environment.yml file  

2) Install deepdisc with  
   `pip install deepdisc`  
   You can also install by cloning this repo and running `pip install [e].`  [e] is optional and will install in editable mode.  Use if you are going to change the source code  

Usage:
```
demo_btk.ipynb
```
This notebook uses simulated images generated using the Blending Toolkit (Mendoza et al 2025).  We used the CatSim (Connolly et al 2014) example catalog provided within the BTK to generate a set of training/test images, and then constructed per-image metadata the network needs to train. The notebook is largely for demo purposes, so does not include full training scheduling and optimizations.
